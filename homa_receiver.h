/**
 * class homa::receiver - Helper class for receiving a series of messages
 * from a Homa socket. This class serves two purposes: first, it implements
 * the application side of the Homa buffer management protocol, returning
 * receive buffer space to Homa when the application longer needs it. Second,
 * it provides convenience methods for accessing messages that are scattered\
 * over several discontiguous regions of buffer space.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * - Call receive, which will invoke Homa to receive an incoming message.
 * - Access the message using methods such as get and copy_out (note: if
 *   the message is shorter than HOMA_BPAGE_SIZE then it will be contiguous).
 * - Call receive to get the next message. This releases all of the resources
 *   associated with the previous message, so you can no longer access that.
 * - Access the new message ...
 *
 * A single homa::receiver allows only a single active incoming message
 * at a time. However, you can create multiple homa::receivers for the
 * same Homa socket, each of which can have one active message. An
 * individual homa::receiver is not thread-safe.
